# SOLID

The SOLID principles are five key design principles in object-oriented programming (OOP), introduced by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob). These principles help make software more maintainable, scalable, testable, and easier to understand.

| Principle | Meaning                                  |
|-----------|------------------------------------------|
| S         | Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)    |
| O         | Open/Closed Principle (OCP)              |
